# webscraping_challenge
It consists of two technical products.Following are deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scraped the titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Exported the data into MongoDB database.

Deliverable 2: Scraped and analyzed Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

Analysis:

- How many months exist on Mars?
    - 12

- How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
    - 1867

- What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? 
    - On average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the eighth month is the warmest. But it is always very cold there in human terms!

- Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
    - Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth.

- About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
    - The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
